# Orang Dalam - The Hidden Forest People

## Overview
**Orang Dalam** (literally "people of the inside" or "inner people" in Malay) refers to cryptid hominids reported in the dense rainforests of peninsular Malaysia and parts of Indonesia, distinct from but related to other Southeast Asian forest people legends. Described as primitive, ape-like humans standing 4-5 feet tall with dark hair covering their bodies, the orang dalam are said to be extremely shy and reclusive, living in the deepest parts of the jungle and avoiding contact with modern humans. Local indigenous communities distinguish them from known animals and claim they represent either undiscovered hominids, surviving Homo floresiensis relatives, or spiritual forest guardians.

**Category:** CRYPTID  
**Danger Level:** Low to Moderate (shy, avoids humans)  
**Origin:** Malaysian and Indonesian rainforests  
**Status:** Well-documented phenomenon with ongoing research
